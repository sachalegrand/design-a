always go in this order :

cd (change directory) to design-a in gitbash

git add (afile or folder i created since last time)  <-- no brackets
if you're not sure, you can go 
git add *
and it will add everything

then

git commit -a -m "thats's what i did"
it checks what the differences are between the repository and your computer

then 

git pull
it will get what's on the repository

then 

git push
it will send what you have on your comoputer to the repository
