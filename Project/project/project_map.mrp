    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,072 out of   2,072 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,072   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.

    Number used as a route-thru:      1,204

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

    IOB Latches:                         12

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.95

Peak Memory Usage:  187 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  7 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   7 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

directory.
WARNING:Security:44 - No license file was found.
WARNING:Security:42 - Your license support version '2012.10' for WebPack expires
in 7 days after which you will not qualify for Xilinx software updates or new
releases.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net humdLowDown_not0001 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

INFO:Security:50 - The XILINXD_LICENSE_FILE environment variable is set to
'C:\Users\Samvit\home\Xilinx.lic'.
INFO:Security:52 - The LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable is set to
'C:\Altera\license.dat'.

INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
